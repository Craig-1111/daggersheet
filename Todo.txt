1. Reformat with flex box vs grid. Grid is fine for the top 2, then make a 
right + left side box and just dump everything inside of them and see if they fit nicely?
Could make pop outs for descriptions or anything over the assigned text limit to make the 
sheet not wonky 
2. Make people able to save what they put on sheets, as well as what other people have done. 
so something like a cloud database. start with firebase I think and then work out from there
3. DiceRolling + chat log

4. get really good at responsiveness. set certain breakpoints + have naturally growing shit to add to movement in between those points

4. Encounter Builder with a grid system that dynamically see's how much a card should take up and
then adjusts how many grids it should span that way. Kinda cool
